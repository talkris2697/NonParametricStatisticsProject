# NonParametricStatisticsProject


**Welcome to the Statistical Learning Library!**

Within this repository, you will find a captivating project that I embarked upon during my college years, delving into the fascinating realm of statistical learning. As you explore this repository, you'll uncover a treasure trove of insights, code, and analytical revelations that have been carefully curated for your perusal.

**Project Overview:**
At the heart of this repository lies a meticulously crafted Jupyter Notebook file, denoted by the ".ipynb" extension. This file serves as an encapsulation of the project's essence, housing both the intricately woven code that powers the analyses and the tangible outcomes that those analyses have unveiled. Dive into this Jupyter Notebook to uncover a comprehensive narrative of data-driven exploration, model building, and inference drawing. Experience firsthand the journey of data points being transformed into profound insights through the alchemy of statistical learning techniques.

**Analyze and Reflect:**
Complementing the Jupyter Notebook is a ".docx" file, an essential companion on your exploration. Within this document, you will discover a meticulously composed analysis of the results that the project has yielded. The ".docx" file provides a structured narrative that guides you through the nuances of the analyses, discussing key observations, drawing insightful correlations, and unraveling the stories that the data has woven. Immerse yourself in the context of the project as you read through this carefully crafted narrative.

**Contributions and Collaborations:**
Your engagement with this repository is not confined to passive observation. Feel free to explore, contribute, and collaborate.
